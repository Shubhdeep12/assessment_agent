# Next Steps

## Agent-Specific Enhancements

### Enhanced Data Management
- Create synchronization mechanisms between local storage (IndexedDB) and the server-side LanceDB, if needed.
- Offer options for users to manage context data dynamically across sessions.

### Self-Learning and Model Improvement
- Log user interactions, generated questions, and feedback securely.
- Develop a retraining pipeline that uses logged responses to fine-tune the model autonomously.
- Schedule periodic evaluations to ensure that any self-trained version does not diverge from expected performance.

### Robust Production Deployment
- Harden security aspects around data handling (both server and client-side).
- Add monitoring and logging to track system performance and debug issues in production.
- Implement versioning or rollback mechanisms for the self-trained model.

### Scalability and Reliability
- Explore containerization and orchestration (like Docker and Kubernetes) for a scalable deployment.
- Establish automated testing and CI/CD pipelines to maintain quality as new features are integrated.

## UI-Specific Enhancements

### Client-Side Data Storage
- Integrate IndexedDB in the web UI to store processed content chunks on the user's browser.
- Implement UI controls for users to review and delete stored data based on individual source files.

### User Experience Enhancements
- Integrate progress tracking and user notifications within the UI for background operations like retraining.
- Design an intuitive interface for users to provide explicit feedback on question quality.
